Learning programming can seem intimidating, but with the right approach, anyone can master the basics and start building their own projects. Here's a beginner's guide to learning programming:

1. Choose your language: There are dozens of programming languages to choose from, but it's best to start with a language that's beginner-friendly and widely used, such as Python or JavaScript.
2. Find quality resources: There are countless resources available for learning programming, but not all of them are created equal. Look for resources that are recommended by experts, such as online courses, textbooks, and video tutorials.
3. Start with the basics: Don't try to tackle advanced concepts right away. Start with the basics, such as variables, data types, and loops, and build your knowledge from there.
4. Practice, practice, practice: Programming is a skill, and like any skill, it requires practice to master. Start with simple projects and gradually work your way up to more complex ones.
5. Join a community: Learning programming can be a lonely endeavor, but it doesn't have to be. Join online communities, attend meetups, and find a mentor to help you stay motivated and learn from others.
6. Keep learning: Programming is constantly evolving, and there's always more to learn. Keep up with the latest developments in your language of choice and continue to challenge yourself with new projects and concepts.

Start small, stay motivated, and keep learning, and you'll be on your way to becoming a skilled programmer.
